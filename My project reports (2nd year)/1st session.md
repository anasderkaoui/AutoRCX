In this session a lot has changed.

I upgraded the power source of the car, so instead of using the conventional power generator that I was using the last year, I have now this power brick loaded with two rechargeable batteries that I can easily plug into the power input cord of the car and let it run !

Next I got rid of some flimsy cable connections that were also ruinning the look of the car. I soldered them instead of just having them held by some tape. They connect the power voltage converter of the servo motor to the main power source breadboard.<br>

This is the old connection:<br>

Here it is now:<br>

Moving on to the Jetson Nano board, I installed a wooden plateform that, now, serves as a base to hold the Jetson board on top of the Arduino UNO card. 
Here is what it looks like now:<br>

The board is not yet connected to the hardware and components of the car, because I am eying to buy another one due to some dependency problems that I had encountered with this particular Jetson Nano.

Last but not least, the car now has a body shell that will add significantly to its aesthetics and make it more eyecatching.<br>

Now what remains to do is to cut some holes in the body shell in order to secure it in place. Then comes the part where I will cut a fraction to let some air flow for the card, that will help cool it down. And after that I am going to add the other accessories that came with the body.
