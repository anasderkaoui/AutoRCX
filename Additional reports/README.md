This repository is dedicated to more in-depth information about the JETSON NANO dev kit card and ROS utility.</br>
Some of the topics discussed here are : 
- [Boot and run the Jetson Nano from SSD](https://github.com/anasderkaoui/AutoRCX/blob/main/Additional%20reports/4th%20report.md) instead of SD card or eMMC (internal flash memory)
- Access Jetson Nano via [remote desktop using XRDP or VNC](https://github.com/anasderkaoui/AutoRCX/blob/main/Additional%20reports/1st%20report.md)
- Using Lidar to do some SLAM
