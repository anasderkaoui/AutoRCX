## This report concludes the journey of the **AutoRCX** !

The robot-car is now able to navigate fully autonomously. All algorithms are made under **ROS 1 Melodic**.

Here are some videos that show the robot moving from point A to point B. This is a very simple scenario, yet complicated to get done correctly!

Find in here all the related algorithms to reach this level of autonomy for an Ackermann (car-like) robot.
