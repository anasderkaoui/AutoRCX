In this session I have reached this level in my project:

The car is fully able to navigate relying only on the battery tha I have received which is great news!
I have looked into the SLAM particle sampling and it does not have anything to do with the issue that I have whcih is map overlapping in SLAM. The particle sampling is a method similar to Monte Carlo Localization. It tries to guess the robot's initial localization, but then Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization takes over.

As of today, the 12/11/2024, I will try to generate a map and perform the SLAM algorithm.

UPDATE:
