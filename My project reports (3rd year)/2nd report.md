In this session I have reached this level in my project:

- The car has some additional components like some sensors and an additional power converter (buck) that are not in use for the moment. I have already removed the power converter but not the sensors, maybe I will use them afterwards.

- The car can be controlled wirelessly with a PS4 controller, it can steer and go back and forth well. Hawever one problem is that, if a lot of instruction are sent, it takes time to do them and will do them entirely even with a big delay. Have to improve the program.

- The final target which is autonomous navigation. Last time I checked, a long time ago, the algorithms implemented seem to be the right ones, but they are not finetuned to the car itself. So I have to create a package with every comprehensive algorithm and its utility and how it helps the car.

As of today, the 01/10/2024, I will concentrate on creating a simulation of the car itself so as to show it in RVIZ.

UPDATE:

I succeded at getting a first look at the car visualization on RVIZ. However, there still some changes to do: The wheels can rotate but independent of each other, I don't know if this is really a problem !
