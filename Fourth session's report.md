# Report of the fourth session

In the fourth session of the building the autonomous RC car, there were some major changes :

- We received the car body that our supervisor bought online for us. The link to it is: [RC car frame](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01FO41EVK/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A066248065M1IW1TJ2D&psc=1). He claims that building the body from scratch is very laborious and requires a lot of 3D printed parts, specifically the steering parts. So the frame that we received today is equipped with all the necessary parts that are hard to make.

- Since the body we received was made of aluminum, the brushless motors that we had will no longer work for the car. Not only because there is no space for the two of them to be mounted in the back of the frame, but also because they can not provide the necessary output to move the heavy body. Consequently, our supervisor provided us with a DC motor, not the one that we had last time that draws 3A under no load, but another motor that claims for more power efficiency.

The DC motor had no gears attached to the end that would turn the gear on the frame, thus turning the wheels. To solve this problem, I 3D-printed a gear that matched both the diameter of the DC motor's shaft, and the depth of the teeth. Howerver, this solution is only temporary. I will be looking for a similar gear made out of a robust material that can resist the load of the DC motor.

- The first thing I proceeded to do, when we received the RC car body, is to try to mount the servomotor that will turn the front wheels in the right and left directions. In the first try I was not successful because a little box, that was glued to the body, was in the way. I removed it, after checking that it is not functional, and placed the servomotor where it needs to be mounted.

- Lastly, our supervisor handed out the wheels of the car, that he bought online, to us. The link to buy the wheels is: [RC car wheels](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00LVMTNQ8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=AFJQIP3HRB6RA&psc=1). Since it was time to go for lunch, I didn't have the opportunity to test the wheels because I was working on getting the driver for the DC motor to work. Howerver, my colleague did manage to put the wheels on the body and they seemed to work very well.
