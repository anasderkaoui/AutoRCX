In this folder you will find the ARDUINO/JETSON code for the AutoRCX car.

#### Note that the Arduino code is fully functionnal, whereas the Jetson code consists of several parts from which some are not complete yet. So you can use the Arduino code while we are working restlessly on the AI part of the Jetson code.
