# Report of the twenty first session

<br />

This is the final session, the next one is when my collegue and I will be presenting the robot.<br />

Today, I dedicated my focus to completing the 3D printing portion of the project, which has been the most time-consuming task. Initially, I printed some dowels to serve as a support for the second base where the Nvidia card would be mounted. Unfortunately, the dowels proved to be a flawed solution, as they were prone to breaking and did not look aesthetically pleasing. After careful consideration, I decided to replace the wooden base with a new one made of Plexiglass. The new material is more rigid and provides excellent support for the Nvidia card.<br />

Meanwhile, I handed over our bricked Nvidia Jetson Nano card to one of our supervisors to take a closer look and see if it could be salvaged. In our [previous session](https://github.com/anasderkaoui/AutoRCX/blob/main/My%20project%20reports/20th%20session's%20report.md), I had accidentally rendered the card unusable. The supervisor suggested reflashing the card with the original firmware, but this required a laptop running Ubuntu, which he was able to find. Unfortunately, the installation was unsuccessful due to driver issues. The supervisor lent me his own Nvidia card to continue working, but I encountered difficulty connecting to the internet, and since I lacked a separate monitor, I was unable to use the spare card effectively. As a result, I switched my focus to the Arduino code.<br />

After designing some new parts on Fusion360, I proceeded to the laser cutter to prepare the supports for both the Nvidia and Arduino cards. Once complete, I packed washers, screws, and nuts to secure them firmly in place.<br />

The next session I will be screwing each one of the components on the Plexiglass parts, finishing up the project.
