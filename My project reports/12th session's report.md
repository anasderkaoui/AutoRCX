# Report of the twelfth session

During this session:<br />

- I mainly focused on 3D printing various car parts. One of the most important parts I worked on was the back sensor carrier, which I had attempted to print previously but with limited success. This time, I made the necessary modifications to ensure that the dimensions of the part were accurate.

I learned from my previous experience and decided to change the material I used for printing. Instead of using PLA, which I used last time, I opted for PETG. This decision was based on the fact that PETG is a stiffer and stronger material, which would result in a better-quality print. After several trials, I succeeded in getting dimensions close to what I needed and was pleased with the overall quality of the print. The new back sensor carrier was much better compared to the one I printed last time and was more durable due to the use of PETG material.

For your information, here is a dive deep into the materials I used and why you should or not use them to 3D print your objects.

PLA (Polylactic Acid) and PETG (Glycol-modified Polyethylene Terephthalate) are two popular thermoplastic materials commonly used in 3D printing.

PLA is a biodegradable, plant-based plastic made from corn starch, sugarcane, or other natural materials. It is known for its ease of use, low warping, and minimal odor during printing. PLA has a relatively low melting temperature, making it a good choice for low-stress applications and objects that will not be subjected to high temperatures. It is also an affordable option for 3D printing, making it a popular choice for beginners and hobbyists. However, it is not as durable or heat-resistant as other materials, making it less suitable for objects that will be exposed to high stress or heat.

PETG, on the other hand, is a transparent, durable, and impact-resistant material that is commonly used in packaging and food containers. In 3D printing, it is known for its strength, flexibility, and ease of printing. It has a high resistance to environmental factors such as moisture, chemicals, and UV light, making it a good choice for objects that will be exposed to these elements. Additionally, PETG has a slightly higher melting temperature compared to PLA, making it more suitable for objects that will be subjected to high stress or heat. However, it can be more challenging to print with compared to PLA due to its slightly more advanced printing properties.

In summary, PLA and PETG are two of the most commonly used materials in 3D printing and have different properties that make them suitable for different applications. PLA is a popular choice for beginners and hobbyists due to its affordability and ease of use, while PETG is favored for its durability, strength, and resistance to environmental factors.<br />

- Additionally, I organized and rearranged the wires in a more organized manner. The task required me to disassemble all the components that were loosely connected by the wires, such as the DC motor driver and the power supply boards. I took the time to carefully group the wires coming out of each component and secured them together with tape. This was done to ensure a clean and neat appearance of the wiring and to make it easier for future modifications or additions to be made without causing any disruption to the current connections. By having a well-organized wiring setup, any modifications or additions can be done quickly and efficiently without causing confusion or causing problems with the existing connections.

Having a well-organized setup has more benefits than you think:

1 - Increased efficiency: When your wiring or components are well organized, you can quickly identify what you need and access it without wasting time searching for it. This saves time and makes your work more efficient.

2 - Improved accuracy: A well-organized setup reduces the risk of mistakes and helps ensure that all connections are made correctly. This is especially important when working with complex systems that require precise connections.

3 - Easier maintenance: When your wiring and components are organized, it is much easier to spot and resolve any problems. This makes maintenance quicker and more efficient, which can save time and money in the long run.

4 - Enhanced troubleshooting: A well-organized setup makes it easier to identify and isolate issues when they occur, allowing you to quickly resolve any problems and get back to work.

5 - Better appearance: A well-organized setup not only functions better, but it also looks better. This can help create a more professional and polished appearance, which can be important in a work or lab environment.

In conclusion, having a well-organized setup can improve efficiency, accuracy, and troubleshooting, while also making it easier to maintain and improving the overall appearance.<br />
