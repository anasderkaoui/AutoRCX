# Report of the twentieth session
<br />

Today was a day of intense focus for me, as I had my sights set on getting the Nvidia Jetson Nano card to work with external modules. With a rapidly approaching project deadline, I knew that having a working lidar and camera was crucial for success.<br/>

During this session, I delved deep into the intricacies of image recognition with a camera. Despite following the guidance of experienced professionals found on the internet, I unfortunately fell short of achieving my goal. While installing various packages and tools onto the Nvidia Jetson card, I encountered several errors that proved to be insurmountable. In my quest for a solution, I scoured online forums where others had experienced similar issues. Ultimately, I followed the advice of a user on the Nvidia forum, only to find that their suggestion ended up bricking the card.<br/>

Undeterred, I continued to troubleshoot, uninstalling and then reinstalling the Nvidia drivers. However, to my dismay, the card became unrecognized by the ssh remote. At this point, I realized I needed to seek assistance from one of my supervisors. I handed over the card to them, and they will attempt to reset it to its default settings and re-flash the original firmware.<br/>

This sad news did not stop me from learning more about ROS. In fact, I have made a [ROS cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aHzvnf_MWg9O6PzCw1KsePNh27TZ9ND01cHMHroUVQE/edit?usp=sharing) that contains some of the basic and most important commands that are frequently used on ROS.<br/>

And, in order to get started with image recognition and know more about it, here is a very useful repository: [Hello AI World](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference#hello-ai-world)<br/>
