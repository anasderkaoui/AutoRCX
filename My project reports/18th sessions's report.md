# Report of the eighteenth session

<br />

Today was another exciting day working on my autonomous RC car project. I was on a mission to create a piece that would hold the laser sensor in place and make sure it didn't go flying off during high-speed maneuvers.<br />
I fired up my 3D printer and got to work, but the first couple of attempts were a bit of a disaster. I mean, we're talking about a piece that looked like it was built by a toddler with a crayon. But hey, I didn't let it get me down. I knew that with a little persistence, I could make something that would actually work.<br />
So, I went back to the drawing board and started tinkering with some new designs. After a few tries, I finally had a prototype that was looking pretty good. It wasn't perfect, but it was definitely an improvement on the hot mess I had made earlier.<br />
I was feeling pretty stoked about the progress I was making, but then I realized that maybe I needed to go back to the drawing board once again. I mean, why settle for "pretty good" when I could make something that was totally awesome, right?<br />
So, I scrapped that design and started working on something new. I put all my skills and knowledge to work and came up with a design that was pretty sick. I haven't printed the final version of it yet, but I'm feeling pretty confident that this is the one that's going to do the trick.<br />

Also, during today's session, I stumbled upon an operating system that could potentially be the solution to our current problem of implementing artificial intelligence into our RC car. This innovative operating system is none other than the Robot Operating System (ROS), which has the capability to train our car to become fully autonomous through the use of cameras and sensors.<br />
I was intrigued by the advantages that ROS could offer, and I quickly dove into some online courses to gain a deeper understanding of this system. What I discovered was truly impressive. ROS provides a robust framework for building advanced robotics applications, offering a wide range of tools and libraries that can greatly simplify the development process.<br />
One of the biggest advantages of ROS is its modularity. This means that developers can build and test different components of their system independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues. Additionally, ROS supports communication between different components, allowing for seamless integration of sensors, controllers, and other hardware.<br />
Another key advantage of ROS is its open-source nature, which has led to a vast community of developers and contributors. This community has developed a wealth of tools, libraries, and resources that can be leveraged to streamline development and improve functionality.<br />
Furthermore, ROS is highly versatile, making it a great fit for a wide range of applications. It has been used in everything from autonomous vehicles and drones to industrial robots and medical devices. With its wide range of features and capabilities, ROS is the perfect platform for developers looking to push the boundaries of robotics and automation.<br />
In conclusion, ROS is a powerful operating system that could potentially revolutionize the development of our RC car. With its modularity, open-source nature, and versatility, ROS provides a robust framework for building advanced robotics applications. By leveraging the capabilities of ROS, we can step up our game and take our RC car to the next level of autonomy.<br />
