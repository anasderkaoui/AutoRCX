# Report of the thirteenth session
<br />

- During my recent 3D printing sessions, my primary focus was to print the back sensor carrier for the RC car. Unfortunately, in my previous attempts, I was unable to get it to fit correctly. It was only after taking some new measurements that I realized the root of the problem: I had been using the wrong 3D printer.<br />
Despite my best efforts, every time I printed a version of the back sensor carrier, the holes were just slightly off. This misalignment was due to my use of a 3D printer equipped with a 0.6mm tip instead of the 0.4mm tip that was better suited for my specific needs.<br />
Once I discovered this error, I printed a new version of the carrier using the correct 3D printer, and I was pleased to find that it had the exact dimensions required and was able to sit securely on the car frame. This experience highlighted for me the importance of using the proper equipment and tools to achieve the desired outcome, and I am excited to continue honing my skills and knowledge in the world of 3D printing.<br />

- Currently, one of the most significant issues we are facing with the RC car frame is that the individual components are not in their optimal positions and are merely resting on top of one another. To address this issue, our supervisor has suggested that we create some large parts that can serve as sturdy bases for each of the car's critical elements.<br />
For instance, the Arduino card will be positioned at the base of the car frame, where it has been situated since the inception of the project. Additionally, we plan to install a separate foundation on top of the car's components that will serve as the main support for all of the power-related elements of the RC car. Finally, we will add a structure to the very top of the car to securely hold the NVIDIA Jetson Nano card in place.<br />
However, due to the previous wire management arrangements and the addition of new parts that occupy a considerable amount of space, it is likely that the wires will need to be reorganized and potentially extended to ensure optimal functionality. By implementing these solutions, we are confident that we can address the current issues and create a more stable and efficient car frame for the project.<br />

- For the time being, I have only laser cut some wooden pieces that will eventually serve as the bases to support the various parts of the car. Before proceeding with the 3D printing process, we need to ensure that these wooden pieces fit correctly and are suitable for holding the car components in place.<br />
Once we have confirmed that the wooden pieces are the right size and position, we will proceed with the creation of high-quality 3D printed parts that will offer greater strength and stability to the car frame. By doing so, we can confidently ensure that the components are securely held in place and able to function as intended. Ultimately, this will lead to a more robust and reliable frame, which is crucial for the success of our project.<br />
