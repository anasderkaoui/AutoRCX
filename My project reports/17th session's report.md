# Report of the seventeenth session

<br />

- Today, I successfully printed the three pieces required for the car's frame, which are specifically designed to firmly hold the ultrasonic sensors in place. While evaluating the assembly, I observed that the sensors, particularly the ones located at the rear, were positioned slightly higher than anticipated, which could potentially impact their ability to detect certain obstacles. Nonetheless, the aesthetic of the car has been substantially improved by eliminating the need for tape to secure the sensors. However, a final aspect that requires careful consideration is the laser sensor located at the front of the car. Its placement presents a complex design challenge, as it necessitates a piece that will securely hold the sensor in place.<br />
  These are the pegs that will hold the ultrasonic sensor carriers in place :<br />

- During this session, our supervisor provided us with a battery suitable for powering our autonomous RC car. We were presented with a choice between a LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery or an NiMH (Nickel-Metal Hydride) battery, and we opted for the LiPo variant. The rationale behind our selection was that the LiPo battery boasts a significantly higher energy density and greater efficiency compared to its competitors. Additionally, the discharge rate of a LiPo battery is much longer than that of an NiMH battery, providing longer operating times for our car.<br />

  To facilitate the charging or discharging process of our battery, we were provided with a balance charger that can cater to various types of batteries with diverse characteristics. However, since the current LiPo battery has already been depleted, we are scouring the internet for a new compatible LiPo battery that can deliver high performance and extend the lifespan of our autonomous RC car.<br />

  As for the characteristics of the LiPo and NiMH batteries, LiPo batteries offer a higher energy density, allowing them to store more power in a smaller and lighter package. They also have a lower discharge rate, making them more suitable for high-performance applications such as RC cars. On the other hand, NiMH batteries have a lower energy density and a higher self-discharge rate but they have a longer lifespan and can be charged and discharged more times than LiPo batteries.<br />

- Also, today I completed the printing of a box that will securely house the Arduino Mega card. Although the initial version of the box was able to fit the card, I had to remove the peg pieces that were designed to fit into the holes and keep the card firmly in place. While the first iteration was functional, it was not optimal, and I am currently working on improving the design of the box.<br />

  The housing box for the Arduino Mega card plays a crucial role in the functioning of the autonomous RC car, as it acts as a protective shield against external factors such as dust, humidity, and physical impact. The process of designing a box that is both aesthetically appealing and functionally efficient involves considering various factors such as material selection, the size and shape of the card, and the placement of connectors and ports.<br />
  To enhance the durability and longevity of the housing box, I am exploring various materials that can offer superior protection against mechanical damage and environmental factors, such as PETG and PLA. I am also looking to incorporate advanced features like cable routing channels, and custom-designed fixtures to increase the functionality and accessibility of the box. Overall, the housing box represents a critical component of the autonomous RC car's infrastructure, and I am committed to delivering a product that is both durable and reliable.<br />

- After making some modifications to the code, I conducted multiple tests to assess the autonomous RC car's performance. Unfortunately, it became apparent that the modifications were not successful, as the car was failing to detect obstacles and colliding with walls despite initially driving straight.<br />
  This occurrence highlights the importance of preserving functional code by creating a backup before attempting modifications. As any programmer knows, tinkering with code carries an inherent risk of introducing unforeseen errors, which can lead to the loss of the initial working code. By creating a backup, developers can revert to the previous version of the code if the modifications result in unwanted outcomes.<br />
  Losing a functional code can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience, causing delays and potentially jeopardizing the success of the project. Therefore, as a best practice, developers should always create a backup of functional code before proceeding with modifications.<br />
  In light of the issues encountered, I am currently reviewing the modifications made to the code and identifying potential errors or discrepancies. I will take a systematic approach to debugging the code and conduct thorough testing before implementing any additional modifications. By doing so, I aim to optimize the car's performance and ensure that it operates as intended.<br />
