# Report of the fifteenth session

<br />

- The latest session of working on our car project proved to be a real turning point in our progress. During this session, we made significant headway in bringing our planning and preparation to fruition, as we were finally able to give the car a complete makeover.<br />

  Our previous efforts had focused on creating structures and components to house and organize each type of hardware needed for the project. This involved a great deal of meticulous planning and design work, with each component requiring a specific structure to house it safely and effectively. However, this session marked the end of this planning phase, as we were finally able to turn our plans into reality through hands-on construction work.<br />

  The result of our labors was truly impressive. We were able to bring to life a sleek and modern design that not only looked impressive, but also functioned at the highest level possible. The car now boasts a clean and organized layout, with each component housed securely in its designated structure. This has not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal of the car, but also improved its overall performance and efficiency.<br />

- The wooden structure that was added to the car has proven to be an excellent support for the Arduino card and other small power boards. These essential components are now located below the wooden piece, hidden from view and not requiring any further adjustments. The placement of the DC/DC converters and DC motor driver was not a simple task, as it involved testing out various layouts and positions before reaching the final result. Ultimately, the DC/DC converters were duct taped to the location where the battery would normally be placed, while the DC motor driver was affixed directly between the motor and the DC motor.<br />

  In order to create the wooden structure, Fusion360 and a laser cutting machine were employed. However, this process was not without its challenges. It was difficult to achieve the exact dimensions required for the car's structure from the outset, leading to at least five versions of the wooden structure being created before the final design was settled on.<br />

  Cable management was also a consideration during the design process. In order to make more space for additional components, some of the cables were shortened, resulting in less interference between the car's various components and less power wastage. By keeping the distances that current has to travel shorter, there is less room for power loss and the car can function more efficiently.<br />

- The addition of the GPS module with a built-in compass has truly been a game-changer for our project. It has allowed us to save a great deal of time and effort that would have otherwise been spent on figuring out where to place each module, had we only had separate GPS and compass modules. The GPS module's ability to pinpoint our car's location with greater accuracy has been particularly valuable, especially when it comes to navigating the car through more challenging terrain.<br />

  Despite this, we are still in the process of fine-tuning the code that will enable us to make full use of the compass module's functionality. Currently, we only have access to the version of the code that utilizes the GPS module, while the compass module's capabilities remain untapped. This means that we will need to scour the internet in order to locate the appropriate code that will allow us to integrate the compass into our system.<br />

  Once we have the code in hand, we anticipate that it will be an invaluable tool in helping the car make informed decisions about which direction to take. By combining the information provided by the GPS and compass modules, the car will be able to navigate its way through complex terrains with greater ease and precision. It is exciting to think about the possibilities that will be unlocked by this powerful technology and we look forward to seeing how it will help us push the boundaries of what is possible with our project.<br />
